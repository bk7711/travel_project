# Wheels Up: a trip planning tool

Sometimes we get the urge to plan a spontaneous solo getaway or might want to wrangle your friends for a group trip without the hassle of trying to coordinate ideas across different platforms. This app allows users to quickly plan a trip tailored to their own specific desires or select a trip from one of our pre-selected travel reccomendations and add on to them.

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repo to your local machine and then run `npm install` in the command line of your terminal. This will initialize the required dependancies needed to make the magic happen!

## Usage
After making sure the dependancies are up and running, make sure the database and `.env` is configured to connect with your database. Start the server to get an idea of what you're working with and then dive right in to make desired enhancements. 

## Future Development
Right now, this deployment is in *beta development*, meaning that there are still improvements being rolled out before the full production launch. There are several features that we hope to update over the course of time but these are the most pressing improvements that we hope will propel the app out of *beta*. 

  - Being in control of what you share is important in a digital era, which is why we want to incorporate public and private trips/getaways.

  - We would like to implement a more interactive social feel to make it easier to connect with mutual friends and see their public boards. Things that pique a user's interest can be saved to a specific trip.

  - A countdown timer for trips that are past the "planning" stage. Reaching the stage where all the details are ironed out and you're just waiting until its time for <strong> Wheels Up </strong> time is the best! Its a tantilizing time to look forward to rest, relaxation, and a delicious Mojito.
